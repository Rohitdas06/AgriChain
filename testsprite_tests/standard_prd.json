  "product_overview": "AgriChain is a blockchain-enabled supply chain transparency platform designed to provide end-to-end traceability and verification of agricultural products from farm to consumer. It leverages decentralized technology, QR codes, and role-based access to improve trust and authenticity in the agricultural supply chain.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Enable secure and transparent tracking of agricultural products across the supply chain using blockchain technology.",
    "Provide role-based dashboards for Farmers, Distributors, Retailers, Consumers, and Admins to manage and verify product data efficiently.",
    "Facilitate seamless product registration, verification, and status updates with QR code generation and scanning features.",
    "Ensure consumer trust through product authenticity verification and item history visibility.",
    "Support administrative oversight including user approvals, transaction monitoring, fraud detection, and policy enforcement."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "User Authentication via MetaMask wallet integration with role-based access control.",
    "Role-based Dashboards tailored for Farmers, Distributors, Retailers, Consumers, and Admins with specific functionalities.",
    "Product Management including adding new products, batch tracking, and timeline visualization.",
    "QR Code Generation for each product batch and QR Code Scanning for consumers to verify product details.",
    "Shipment and Transport Status Updates by Distributors and delivery confirmations by Retailers.",
    "Product History and Authenticity Verification accessible to consumers upon scanning QR codes.",
    "Admin Features including user approval workflows, viewing all transactions, analytics, and policy integration.",
    "Support pages including Profile Settings, Notifications, Help/Support, and error handling pages for 404 and unauthorized access."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User logs in through MetaMask wallet and selects their role (Farmer, Distributor, Retailer, Consumer, Admin).",
    "Farmers add product details and generate QR codes for product batches via their dashboard.",
    "Distributors accept products from farmers, update transport statuses, and track shipments.",
    "Retailers receive products, confirm deliveries, update store availability, and print QR codes for packaging.",
    "Consumers scan QR codes to view product history, verify authenticity, and track chain of custody.",
    "Admins manage user approvals, monitor transactions, analyze data for fraud detection, and enforce policies.",
    "Users access support features such as profile settings, notifications, and help pages.",
    "Unauthorized attempts are redirected to an Unauthorized Access page; non-existent routes go to a 404 page."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "Successful MetaMask wallet authentication with proper role assignment upon login.",
    "Role-specific dashboard functionalities operate correctly (e.g., product addition for Farmers, transport updates for Distributors).",
    "QR Code generation and scanning workflows produce accurate, verifiable blockchain-backed data.",
    "Product timelines accurately reflect the chain of custody and status updates from farm to consumer.",
    "Users can view notifications and support pages without errors.",
    "Admin features allow effective user approval, transaction review, and analytics report generation.",
    "Unauthorized routes and access attempts are properly handled and displayed.",
    "System performance remains stable under typical user load during workflows across roles."
